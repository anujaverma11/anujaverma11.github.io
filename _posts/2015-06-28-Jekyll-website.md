#Working with Jekyll

This last week I got introduced to a new concept in the world of Blogging. Deploying your blogs using a fantastic concept of Jekyll. So I rolled up my sleves and started searching all I can get and learn about Jekyll.

As it was a very new experiance and first time I have ever heard something about Jekyll. I started searching internet to find any resource I can lay my hands on and move my blogs to Jekyll.

Declaration: As I am still not a Jekyll geek I will keep improving this page and this complete website to record my experience in theory and in practical.

For my Jekyll learning, following are some of the references:

- [Andrew Munsell Course](https://www.andrewmunsell.com/courses-overview/)
- [Using Jekyll with Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/)
-[Jekyll Documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)

Issues I got into and found my answers while troubleshooting:

- Why my jekyll is not building after successfull installation?
- I have to exit from my terminal and restart it after all installation where completed.

- Can I copy all my files and deploy in a new folder?
- Yes I initially started in a new repository and then moved my code to where I actually want. I just copied and build jeykll in the target repository folder.
