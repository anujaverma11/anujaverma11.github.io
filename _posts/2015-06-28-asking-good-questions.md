# Asking Good Questions

Every question is a good question. So then what this heading means and why we are discussing about a good question?

This is coming from a personal experience where I have asked questions on social website or may be on some workplace knowledge websites and ended up getting no answer or may be an altogether wrong answer. Today going back and analyzing those questions gave me a sense into how wrong I was.... not about asking that question but asking a question which left the reader or my intended audience guessing what I actually meant. So I reserched how can I ask my every good question in a meaningful way.

So to improve my questions to score an answer I made a checklist.
(P.S. Most of the point in this checklist are specific to Technical questions)

Include in your question
- Most of the website require a title and then problem description
- Write the title to summarize specific problem
- Language and Platform Version (Ruby 2.0.0)
- Operating System
- Sample code and data to explain the problem
- Check Spelling and grammar before posting
- Proof read before posting a question
