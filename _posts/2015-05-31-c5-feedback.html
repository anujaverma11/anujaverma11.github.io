      Pairing to work on a challenge has been a good experience.Problem solving by collaborating with someone gives a sense of understanding of how others tackle a challenge. What are the different tactics they apply to solve a problem. How others research and what all good tips you can apply in your work.

      Every collaboration while working on a challenge is fun and rewarding, rewarding in the sense that you take away something from the challenge.
       I feel the advantages of collaboration new innovations, increased sharing of information and better capacity to solve complex problems.

      Reading my own feedbacks helped me understand how I pair with others, how much I take and interperate their suggestions. It on the other hand give a clarity of how others feel about you. I might think I am integrating well with others but feedback helps me understand where I am lacking. Feedback also helps me to understand which areas of technical and cultural skills I have to improve and that too very politely!!!
