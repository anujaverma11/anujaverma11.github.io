<h4>What is Enumerable method?</h4>
<p>
An enumerable method is an object that may be enumerated. "Enumerated" means to count off the members of a set/collection/category one by one (usually in order, usually by name).
</p>
<p>
Enumerable methods can also be used to filter a collection of objects based on one or more selection criteria. One such method is group_by.
<p>
group_by groups the collection by result of the block. Returns a hash where the keys are the evaluated result from the block and the values are arrays of elements in the collection that correspond to the key. The syntax: </p>
<code>
group_by { |obj| block } â†’ a_hash

<br>
cats = ["Tiger", "Lion", "Puma", "Leopard", "Jaguar",
        "Cheetah", "Bobcat"] #1
<br>
grouped_by_length = cats.group_by { |cat| cat.length } #2
<br>
#{5=>["Tiger"], 4=>["Lion", "Puma"], 7=>["Leopard", "Cheetah"], 6=>["Jaguar", "Bobcat"]} #3
</code>
<p>
<br>To understand the above code:
<br>#1 This is an array with different kinds of Cats.
<br>#2 Using Group_by on array cats which willgroup the collection by result based on condition in the block.
<br>#3 Hash is returned which has length as keys and values as the elements from the array cats.
