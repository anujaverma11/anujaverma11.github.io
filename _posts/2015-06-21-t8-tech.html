  <h1>NoSQL databases</h1>

      NoSQL means Not Only SQL, implying that when designing a software solution or product, there are more than one storage mechanism that could be used based on the needs.<br>
      A NoSQL (often interpreted as Not only SQL) database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Motivations for this approach include simplicity of design, horizontal scaling, and finer control over availability.

    <h5>The Benefits of NoSQL</h5>
    <p>

When compared to relational databases, NoSQL databases are more scalable and provide superior performance, and their data model addresses several issues that the relational model is not designed to address:

Large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data
Agile sprints, quick iteration, and frequent code pushes
Object-oriented programming that is easy to use and flexible
Efficient, scale-out architecture instead of expensive, monolithic architecture
    </p>
