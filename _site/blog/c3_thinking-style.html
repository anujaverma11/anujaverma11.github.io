  <h1>Thinking Style and learning</h1>
  <h4>Sunday, May 17, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      The <a href='http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html'>Personal Thinking Style</a> results that I have a thinking style more of Concrete Random. As per <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc's Mind Styles model</a> a Concrete random person likes
      <ul>
        <li>experimenting to find answers</li>
        <li>take risks</li>
        <li>use their intuition</li>
        <li>solving problems independently</li> <br>


      And learns best when:
        <li>they are able to use trial-and-error approaches</li>
        <li>able to compete with others</li>
        <li>given the opportunity to work through the problems by themselves.</li>
<br>
  To use this in my best interest at DBC, I have started focusing on what actually my learning likes are. Experimenting to find answers has been worked well for me, this has strengthen my learning ability. Experimenting or trying to resolve given problems helps retain the concepts.
</p>
  <p>The biggest struggle however which is also indicated by my thinking trait is 'able to compete with others'. When in phase 0 all you have to do is learn by yourself. Phase 0 helps in developing you towards what is coming in further phases, however as you are working all by yourself you have to focus and compete with yourself as well. There is a community which will help you to grow together however in phase 0 you are just competeing with yourself.

<h4>Fixed vs Growth Mindset </h4>
<p>A “fixed mindset” assumes that our character, intelligence, and creative ability are static. A “growth mindset,” on the other hand, thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities.</p>
<p>Hence to build your mindset towards a growth Mindset:
<ul>

<li>Differentiate between fixed and growth mindset voice, If you recognize what is Fixed you will know when to ignore it.

<li> A fixed mindset avoid challenges, give up easily, see efforts as fruitless or worse, ignore useful negative feedbacks and feel threatened by the success of others.
<br>Whereas;
 <br> A growth mindset
  <br>- embrace challenges
  <br>- persist in the face of setbacks
  <br>- see efforts as the path to mastery.
  <br>- take criticisim positively
  <br>- Find lessons and inspirations in the success of others.
<br><br>
  This said, if you know that you have to be positive like a growth mindset, you will build the qualities of a growth mindset.
