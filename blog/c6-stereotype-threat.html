      “Stereotype Threat,” the threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype. Till today I was not even aware that there is something called Stereotype threat.

      Being an Indian by birth and moved to US, as they call it, was an achievement for my American dream. And couldn't agree more that this country welcomed me with whole heartedness. But that said I also represent a community called "women". And the sense of proving now and then that I can drive, read maps and code, and if I commit mistake in any of the said, its because I am also a human being.

      It is being rightly said by Dr Claude Steele “If you care about what you are doing, the prospect of being judged is upsetting and distressing and disturbing,”. So when you walk into a conference room full of men and you being a single woman, you also walk with a shield around (or just a feeling of having something which can protect you from the thought process).
