      Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over a period of time, so that you can recall the older version in future, if needed.
      A version control system is mostly based around one concept, tracking changes that happen within directories or files. Depending on the version control system, this could vary from knowing a file changed to knowing specific characters or bytes in a file have changed.
      With Version control you can easily track your changes,if you broke your code, you can go back to a working code more easily.
      It easier to collaborate i.e., more people can work from one code baseline.Also version controlling is also taking care of backup of your data.

      GIT is a Version Control System. When a person is working with Git, they just don't work on their piece but actually they have the complete repository of code. Git tracks changes to the entire content. Git has three stages of content. Commited, Staged, Modified.

      Github is a distributed version control system, this means is that if you clone a git project, you have the entire project history. You can commit, branch and tag all on you local machine without interacting with a server at all. If you were working with subversion or another centralized VCS all of your interactions occur with the server.
      It acts like a project's central repository and all the developers push and pull their changes to and from that repository. GitHub takes this a step further by encouraging developers to fork a project's repository and then use that as their own centralized repository. From there they can send "pull requests" to the main project with their changes and then the project maintainers can review them before deciding whether to include them in their project or not.
