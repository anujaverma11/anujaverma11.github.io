      Dev Bootcamp is a wonderful place to learn and focus on your passion. Passion of working and making beautiful things. When I first paid for it I was under impression that it will be like a tutorial place where I will learn new technologies and will use them to accomplish new place in the technology world.

        My prospective of DevBootcamp started changing from the day I started working on Pre-requisites of Phase 0. I realized this is just not working on my technology skills. But my overall personality is changing, by every minute. From learning the basic skills of how to learn, socialize and even to keep myself updated to making a place and precence n the tech society.

        Its not someone Spoon feeding you. Its how you are holding that spoon yourself and learning to feed yourself with enormous knowledge and skills.
