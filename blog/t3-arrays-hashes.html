  <h1>Ruby - Arrays and Hashes</h1>
  <h4>Saturday, May 16 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <h4>Arrays</h4>
    <p>
      Ruby arrays are ordered, integer-indexed collections of any object. Each element in an array is associated with and referred to by an index. Arrays can hold objects such as String, Integer, Fixnum, Hash, Symbol, even other Array objects.

      <p>Array index starts from 0, and each slot is given a subsequent number. A negative index is assumed to be relative to the end of the array---that is, an index of -1 indicates the last element of the array, -2 is the next to last element in the array, and so on.</p>

      Creating Arrays:
      <code>
      example = Array.new(20)
      </code>

      Any slot which is not assigned to a value, contains a nil.

      Following are some of the methods that can be used to manipulate arrays
        </ul>
          <li> push - adds an object to the end</li>
              <code>example.push 'Array End'</code>
          <li>pop - removes the last object of an array</li>
          <li>last - dispalys lasy object of an array</li>
          <li>unshift -  will add a new item to the beginning of an array.</li>
          <li>insert - you can add a new element to an array at any position.</li>
              <code>example.insert(3, 'apple')</code>
          <li>shift - To retrieve and at the same time remove the first item, use shift:</li>
              <code>arr.shift #=> 1</code>
          <li>delete_at - To delete an element at a particular index:</li>
              <code>arr.delete_at(2) #=> 4</code>
          <li>delete -
          To delete a particular element anywhere in an array, use delete:</li>
              <code>
              arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]
              arr.delete(2) #=> [1, 3]
              </code>
          <li>uniq -
          Another common need is to remove duplicate elements from an array.</li>
              <code>
              arr = [2, 5, 6, 556, 6, 6, 8, 9, 0, 123, 556]
              arr.uniq #=> [2, 5, 6, 556, 8, 9, 0, 123]
              </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>Hashes</h4>
          Hashes are a lot like arrays. Hash is a collection of Key-value pairs. In Hashes, unlike array, its index is not sequential numbers. Infact any object can be used to refer a slot.

          Hashes are defined as follows:
              <code>
              my_hash = Hash.new
              my_hash = { "Fruit" => "Apple",
                          "Drink " => "Beer",
                          "hungry?" => true
                        }
              </code>
          To access a Hash following command can be used:
            <<code>
              puts my_hash["Fruit"]
            </code>
    </p>
    <p>
<h4>Why you would use one over the other? </h4>
  <p>
    They both are good for different things. A hash is often (but not always) faster than an array because you do not have to search through all the elements to find what you are looking for - you only have to check a few elements
